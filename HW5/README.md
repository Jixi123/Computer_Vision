# Video Tracking

In this assignment, I implemented multiple versions of the Lucas-Kanade tracker. This allows us to track an object in a video. The results are summed up below in the first 3 videos below. The last video shows an example of a failure points in certain versions of the Lucas-Kanade tracker. In this specific failure point, it fails due to the tracked object(the car) being partially obscured by a traffic light, causing the tracker to think the traffic light is a part of the car resulting in the bounding box growing in size as the car moves further away.
