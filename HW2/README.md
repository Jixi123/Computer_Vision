# Planar Homographies

This assignment involved finding similar features in images using feature detectors and then computing the homographies between the 2 images, allowing us to project one image onto another. In the first part, we were given a picture of the cover of The sorcerers stone, an image of a computer vision textbook lying on a desk, and then another image of the cover of the same computer vision textbook. By finding the similar features between the 2 tedxtbook images and then computing the homography that transforms the cover to the one on the desk, we can use that same homography to project the Harry Potter Book onto the textbook Book lying on the desk, making it seem as if it was the Sorcerers Stone on the desk.

Next, we were tasked to do something similar but with a video instead. The first two show the original videos, and the 3rd result is the result of projecting the video of the playground onto the textbook

Finally, for extra credit, we were tasked with creating a script that took two images and stitched them together to create a panorama. I took the images below myself right outside of my dorm building in the courtyard.
